- I have experience in the R&D sector as an embedded software developer, working for [Altus S.A.](https://www.altus.com.br)
  
  (São-Leopoldo, RS, Brazil).
  
- I have intermediate knowledge in electrical/electronic engineering, including handling hardware systems. I work with registers and processor memory architecture, programming both on bare metal and with HAL, RTOS and embedded Linux.
  
- I am committed to clean and understandable codes, making the low level comprehensible for anyone.

- I stay curious and focus on things I want to learn, getting better at technologies I already know.

I have extensive knowledge in low-level programming:
- Knowledge of hardware, focused on logic circuits and digital systems, with an emphasis on registers and memory allocation operations, such as interrupt vectors
- Manipulating strings, arrays, structures, types, pointers and files in C;
- As manipulating physical memory addresses and register directly, with experience of creating my own HAL libraries;
- Alocating irq callbacks directly in assembly, thus creating generic interrupt handlers;
- using compilation attributes, and compilation flags;
-  Creating large repositories and versioning with makefile;
-  Read and manipulating linker files and .map;
###
- Linux operating systems, with thread schedulers;
- Kernel manipulation, device trees and creating drivers from scratch;
- Boot devices with u-boot and buildroot;
- Integration with multi-target repositories using git flow, git lab, git hub and git in the terminal;
- Use vscode and eclipse-based IDEs, such as Atollic TrueSudio and CubeIDE, from STMmicroelectronics, Code Composer Studio, from Texas Instruments and also the Arduino IDE;
- Virtio communication protocols, IPC with shared memory and SoCs with subsystems (like AM62x);
- I'm currently training to use the terminal's own editor, vim, with the help of the "oh-my-bash" extension.
- Some experience with compiler creation steps such as lexer and parsing;
